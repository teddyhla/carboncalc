## Assumptions

- Breakdown of carbon footprint
The carbon foot print is more accurately subdivided into carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide levels. For parsimony, we have reported a total equivalent carbon dioxide as a single value.

- Course Duration
Based on our experience with POCUS courses, we have assumed a **two** full-day of face-to-face course. 

- Assumed that all international travels are at a 'economy class' travel. 

- Assumed that all local travel are calculated at a 'national rail' level without additional use of cars, buses, taxis. 

- For accommodation, we assumed that each participant / instructors are staying in separate individual rooms without sharing for two nights.

## Formula Source

We have used [UK governmental green house gas emissions source](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2022) as a reference.
